 - A function is a named subprogram, designed to perform a particular task 
 - Functions are executed when they are called. Also known as invoking the function 
 - Values Can be passed and used within the function 
 - Functions may recieve argumants / parameters or may not

#### Declaring a function 
 - Functions can be declared in two ways - by using function declaration or by 'function expression' 

#### Invoking a function 
 - Functions are first declared, then invoked 
 - Finctions can be invoked / called by their name  

#### Returning values 
 - The 'return' keyword immediately stops the functions's execution 
 - Returns the specific value to the caller 

#### Nested functions 
 - Functions can be nested / hold other functions
