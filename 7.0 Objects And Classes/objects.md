# Lecture 6: Objects and Classes 

## Cotent: 

#### What are objects: 
 - Structure of related data or functionality 
 - Objects hold key-value pairs, values are accessed by indexing with key 
 - Data values are called properties 
 - Function values are called methods  
 - In JS we can create object with an object literal or we can define an empty object 

#### Value and Refferency Types: 
 - JS has 7 primitive data types that are copied by value (boolen, string, number, null, undefined, symbol, BigInt  
 - JS has 7 data types that are copied by having their refference copied (Array, Object and Functios) these are all techincally Objects 
 - If a primitive type is assigned to a variable, we can think of that variable as containing the primitive value 
 - Varibales that are assigned a non-primiteve value are given a refference to that value 

#### JSON: 
 - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation 
 - Open-standart file format that uses text to transmit data objects 
 - JSON is language independent 
 - JSON is self-describing and easy to understand 
 - Mostly used for exchange data between browser and server 

#### Classes: 
 - Classes are templates for crating objects and define their stucture and behavior 
 - An object, created by the class pattern is called an instance of that class  
 - A class has a constructor - method called automatically to create an object 
 - Classes can also have functions as property, called methods
