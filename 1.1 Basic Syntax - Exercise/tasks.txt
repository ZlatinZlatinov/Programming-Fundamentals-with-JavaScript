Here are the conditions for every problem: 

01. Ages: 
 - Write a function that determines whether based on the given age a person is: baby, child, teenager, adult, elder.
 - The input comes as a single number parameter. The bounders are:
  •	0-2 (age) – is a baby;   
  •	3-13 (age) – is a child; 
  •	14-19 (age) – is a teenager;
  •	20-65 (age) – is an adult;
  •	>=66 (age) – is an elder; 
  •	In all other cases print – "out of bounds";

02. Routing: 
 - Write a JS function that rounds numbers to a specific precision.
 - The input comes as two numbers. The first value is the number to be rounded and the second is the precision (significant decimal places). If the passed precision is more than 15, it should automatically be reduced to 15.
 - Remove trailing zeroes, if any (you can use parseFloat (number))
 - The output should be printed to the console. Do not print insignificant decimals. 

03. Division:
 - You will be given a number and you have to check whether that number is divisible by any of the following numbers: 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10. You should always take the bigger division. 
 - If the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 it is also divisible by 6 and you should print only the division by 6. If a number is divisible by 2 it is sometimes also divisible by 10 and you should print the division by 10. 
 - If the number is not divisible by any of the given numbers print: "Not divisible". Otherwise, print: "The number is divisible by {number}".

04. Vacation: 
 - You are given a group of people, the type of the group, and the day of the week they are going to stay. Based on that information calculate how much they have to pay and print that price on the console. Use the table below. In each cell is the price for a single person. 
 - The output should look like that: `Total price: {price}`.The price should be formatted to the second decimal point. 
 - There are also discounts based on some conditions:
  •	Students – if the group is bigger than or equal to 30 people you should reduce the total price by 15%
  •	Business – if the group is bigger than or equal to 100 people 10 of them can stay for free
  •	Regular – if the group is bigger than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 20 reduce the total price by 5%
Note: You should reduce the prices in that EXACT order.

05. Leap Year:
 - Write a JS function to check whether a year is a leap. Leap years are either divisible by 4 but not by 100 or are divisible by 400. The output should be following:
  •	If the year is a leap, print: "yes"
  •	Otherwise, print: "no" 
  
06. Print and Sum: 
 - Write a function that displays numbers from given start to given end and their sum. The input comes as two number parameters. 
 
07. Triangle of Numbers: 
 - Write a function, which receives a single number – n, and prints a triangle from 1 to n

08. Multiplication Table: 
 - You will receive a number as a parameter. Print the 10 times table for this number. 
 
- The other ones are bonus exercises.
